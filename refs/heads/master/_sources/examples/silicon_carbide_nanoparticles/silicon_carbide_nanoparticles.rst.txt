Silicon carbide nanoparticles 
====================================
One may use this package to create initial structures for nanoparticle simulations. By simulating these particles forward in time using molecular simulation techniques, one may investigate phenomena such as `faceting of nanoparticles <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.9b00612>`_. 

Creating input structures like in the paper linked above can be done by the following scripts, resulting in the systems pictured below each script:
