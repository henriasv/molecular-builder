Silicon carbide nanoparticles 
====================================
One may use this package to crate initial structures for nanoparticle simulations. By simulating these particles forward in time using molecular simulation techniques, one may investigate phenomena such as (faceting of nanoparticles)[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.9b00612]. 

Creating input structures like in the paper linked above can be done by the following scripts, resulting in the systems pictured below each script:
